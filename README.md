Practical Applications of Microcontrollers Project: This project controls a strip of 24 WS2812B LEDs using an STM32F103C8T6 microcontroller. The data signal is generated using Timer2 in PWM mode, and values are transferred via DMA to minimize CPU load. LEDs are individually controlled in GRB format, with effects like blinking or roulette. The project uses HAL libraries and does not require CubeIDE.
